It is a funded startup co-created at The Hive in Palo Alto, CA that delivers artificial intelligence based virtual support expert systems for datacenter service fulfillment and incident resolution.As data center vendors move from on premise to the cloud their existing support system lacks the agility and cost-effectiveness for the cloud. Peritus significantly enhances operational efficiencies of existing support services, and enables managed service providers & system vendors to offer new business continuity entitlements. Peritus assists & automates a wide spectrum of decisions in system support including incident classification, routing, contract coverage, incident resolution recipes and orchestration of incident management between subject matter experts (SMEs).Peritus’ unique vectorization of system log data drives predictive modeling with highly granular feature extraction for early detection of system events. The platform’s advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities drive Peritus’ incident modeling and predictive capabilities.

NESAP postdocs collaborate with scientific teams to enable the solution of deep, meaningful problems across all program areas funded by the Department of Energy Office of Science.NERSC provides world-class supercomputing, high performance, scalable data systems and services to 7000 users across more than 600 projects running 800 different codes. NERSC’s science impact is acknowledged by over 2000 publications per year.The Challenge: Enabling advanced data-intensive science at scale on energy-efficient supercomputers. In 2020, NERSC will begin deploying its first production heterogeneous CPU/GPU-based Cray supercomputer, “Perlmutter.” Perlmutter, a system optimized for science, includes future-generation AMD CPUs, next-generation NVIDIA GPUs, a high-speed interconnect, and an all-flash file system. Many codes running at NERSC must be adapted or optimized to run efficiently on GPUs, and solutions that put GPU performance in the hands of users must be portable ones. NESAP is about employing cutting-edge computational science techniques and advanced performance analysis tools to develop highly scalable, distributed parallel algorithms to meet this challenge.NESAP for Data (N4D): This posting is focused on the data-intensive science workload on Perlmutter. To answer today’s most complex experimental challenges, scientists are collecting exponentially more data and analyzing it with new computationally intensive algorithms. N4D addresses data-intensive science pipelines that process massive datasets from experimental and observational science (EOS) facilities like synchrotron light sources, telescopes, microscopes, particle accelerators, or genome sequencers. The goal is seamless integration and data flow between EOS facilities and supercomputing resources to enable scalable real-time data analytics: A “Superfacility.”As a N4D Fellow, you will be a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of computational and domain scientists working together to transition and optimize codes to the Perlmutter system and produce mission-relevant science that pushes the limits of HPC. You will carry out code transition efforts in collaboration with a project PI and team members with the support of NERSC and vendor staff.

Corporate Affairs focuses on issues most relevant to our business and where we believe we can have the greatest impact. Namely, (1) people: enabling people to reach their full potential in a digital economy (2) society; scaling inclusive social and economic impact in countries around the world and (3) planet; advancing environmentally sustainable growth in a digital world.We focus on helping people develop the digital skills to participate, innovate, and thrive in the digital economy. We’re investing in breakthrough, early-stage, technology-based solutions that address social and environmental challenges and have the potential to scale, replicate, and be sustainable. We work with governments, educational institutions, customers, NGO’s and other partners to support and drive inclusive growth.We created Cisco Networking Academy, a free SaaS platform that offers technology and 21st century skills to improve career and economic opportunities for people around the world, and proved that technology, when combined with education, changes lives. Two decades and more than 7.6 million students later, the Networking Academy program has expanded to 180 countries. Working with educational institutions across the globe, we prepare students for entry-level jobs and industry-recognized certifications. The Networking Academy is built to be adaptable for students with diverse abilities.We take a venture-capital-like approach to making strategic social investments. Cisco Public Benefit Investment and the Cisco Foundation support non-profit organizations that leverage technology to support underserved communities around the world to meet critical human needs and disaster relief, build a digital foundation to improve education, and drive economic empowerment and an inclusive digital economy.We believe impact multiplies and innovative solutions arise when passionate people and transformative technology come together. By empowering a network of talented, innovative, entrepreneurial problem solvers to capitalize on digitization, we can unlock the potential for all people to be included, and for society and the planet to thrive for generations to come.What you’ll doReporting to VP of Engineering and Sustainability, Corporate Affairs, this position will ideally be filled by a seasoned technical leader/architect with engineering/computer science background and 15+ years of experience in building platforms and cloud-based solutions to solve complex business problems.The role requires a hands-on architect with extensive knowledge of agile software development process; deep understanding and experience in architecting scalable, highly available, and data-driven applications leveraging latest tools and technologies; experience in taking ideas to successful launch leading and mentoring diverse, geo distributed teams through innovation, bootstrapping, pilot, production, scaling, and maintenance phases with multiple stakeholders to the highest levels of quality and performance; and full-stack development experience.This individual will be a key part of the technical leadership team, responsible for the CSR digital platform and co-development of solutions in the education, social benefit and environmental sustainability areas with our NGO and education partners.Who you areWhy CiscoWe embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Working together, the Physician and the RN Provider are able to provide complete and highly efficacious treatment to patients presenting with a combination of large vein disease and medium/small vein disease.Specialization also affords RN Providers with the opportunity to work towards and build semi-independent practices with patients that present with just medium and small vein disease.The RN Providers are integral to both clinical and practice building operations. While RN Providers, as well as the physicians, are supported by a strong operational team at both the clinic and the Home Office that provide a multitude of services ranging from marketing to billing and collections to patient financial planning to patient services, they also participate, as do the Physicians, in local practice building activities. These activities include participation in the Referring MD programs designed to create referrals from other physician practices and managing and maintaining long-term relations with their own patient base in order to retain existing patients and create referrals from friends and family members of existing patients. All of these activities benefit the clinic practice generally and their own practices in particular.With the benefits of creating and managing a semi-independent practice also come the responsibilities inherent in any mutually supportive team effort.RESPONSIBILITIES:At the direction of the Physician, assist the Physician in treating all patients, and at the direction of the Physician, maintain a separate schedule specifically for the treatment of Medium and Small Vein Disease. RN Providers are responsible for maintaining clinic inventory of medical supplies (including prepared solution), and are expected to assist the clinic team in practice building and administrative activities when possible.DUTIES:The duties of the RN Provider fall into four equally important categories that are integral to the success of the practice:Clinical SupportPractice BuildingAdministrative SupportPractice Management and TreatmentCOMPLIANCE:All other duties as assigned.RN EDUCATIONAL/LICENSURE/CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS']","[""Assist the Physician with treatment of all patients including ELT, Sclerotherapy, Trapped Blood and Ulcer.\nComplete and ensure that, “Before and After” photographs have been taken for all patients, and photos are properly printed and organized into the appropriate patient file.\nAssist the Physician by thoroughly educating the patients on their treatment protocol as well as their responsibilities and possible complications.

The unit conducts its operations at more than 75 locations worldwide. See also https://www.afimsc.af.mil/Units/Air-Force-Civil-Engineer-Center/The goal of this project is the development of the fundamental principles and practical approaches for fabrication of the fluid-impregnated textile-based materials with energy dissipation built into materials to absorb or re-direct energy away from the target. We propose to take advantage of the combined effect of complex rheology of impregnating fluids, controlled surface energy and porosity with mechanical characteristics of high-performance fibrous materials. The high surface area of the fabric pores and nanoparticles as well as interactions at the interfaces involved has never been explored. We expect that controllably reducing the surface energy of fibers and nanoparticles in the structures, one can increase the probability for air bubbles and thin air films to nucleate at these surfaces. Therefore, the air will provide a caution and effective dissipation mechanism redistributing the compressive and tensile stresses uniformly over the material, therefore synergistically working together with the fibers. The student will experimentally and theoretically study these phenomena and design the materials and methods for efficient fabric impregnation. The participant should, upon finishing the fellowship, be able to synthesize technical materials and science/engineering knowledge to identify and solve problems of interest; design and conduct experiments to meet the requirements for solving those problems of interest; analyze and explain the resulting data; and demonstrate practical skills in materials science/engineering.Appointment LengthThis appointment is a twelve month research appointment, with the possibility to be renewed for additional research periods.

NSA's Linguists, known as Multidisciplined Language Analysts (MDLAs), are expected to take an inclusive approach to problem solving and mission accomplishment by frequently engaging with partners, enablers, and customers across the Intelligence Community.\nDescription of Position\nNSA MDLAs are hired into the Language Analysis Development Program (LADP) or, in the case of MDLAs with extensive experience in Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), directly into positions supporting an analytic mission office.\nThe LADP, which lasts up to three years, is designed to provide an intensive, accelerated opportunity to acquire the unique technical skills and experience needed to successfully apply knowledge and analytic ability to the SIGINT mission and help MDLAs achieve core analytic competencies in accordance with the Cryptologic Training System Training Standard and the MDLA competencies framework. The program includes 4-5 operational tours in a variety of offices, interspersed with formal classroom and computer-based training. These on-the-job operational tours are primarily focused on analyzing foreign language materials within the framework of the two main SIGINT disciplines of intelligence analysis - SIGINT reporting and SIGINT development.\nMultidisciplined Language Analysts are at the forefront of carrying out NSA's SIGINT mission, and they do so in a variety of ways. MDLAs:\n- Offer U.S. policymakers and military leaders a window into the foreign language world of intelligence targets by analyzing, transcribing, and translating key information\n- Research and understand foreign intelligence targets, how they operate, and how they fit in the larger geo-political context\n- Apply new techniques and develop creative solutions to address analytic problems such as synthesizing large volumes of data and disparate sources of information\n- Demonstrate a firm understanding of the communications environment and technology trends of foreign intelligence targets\n- Craft written and oral assessments of foreign intelligence that provide unique insights into target intentions unavailable from other intelligence disciplines\n- Work independently and collaborate effectively (both within NSA and with other analysts in the Intelligence Community) in research, analysis, and reportingSkillsThe ideal candidate is intellectually curious, has a desire for continual learning, and is:\n- Proficient (reading and listening) in one or more critical foreign languages, including Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Somali, Persian Farsi, Korean, Turkish and other languages as missions and needs evolve\n- Well organized and able to handle multiple assignments\n- A strong written and oral communicator\n- Able to synthesize information to solve complex problems\n- Able to provide timely and accurate customer service\nCoursework, knowledge, and experience in one or more of the following is desired:\n- Target development\n- Social network analysis\n- Metadata analysis\n- Research methodology\n- Topical or Regional studies relevant to national security\n- Quantitative/Statistical analysis\n- Data modeling, mining, or science\n- Cyber security\n- Computer science or networking\n- Telecommunications\nRelevant Internships, extracurricular activities, and/or foreign study are also considered.\nPrior military without a degree but with language analysis cryptologic experience will be considered.\nIn most cases, Experienced Level Language Analysts at NSA will have substantial experience in one or more of the following areas:\n- Performing language quality control;\n- Serving as an established Subject Matter Expert (SME);\n- Authoring and releasing reports;\n- Mentoring, coaching, and leading other Language Analysts;\n- Ensuring the technical health of the mission;\n- Mastering and coaching others on the use of a variety of internal tools;\n- Testing at Interagency Language Roundtable (ILR) 3/3 levels for one or more mission languages; and\n- Displaying a broad knowledge of the Intelligence Community and how various elements work together to prosecute mission.Pay, Benefits, & Work ScheduleOn-the-job training, Internal NSA courses, and external training will be made available based on the need and experience of the selectee.\nMonday - Friday, with basic 8hr/day work requirements between 0600 and 1800 (flexible).\nNSA hires for a variety of locations, to include: Maryland, Georgia, Hawaii, Texas, Utah, and other locations.Position SummaryAs a language analyst, you will use your passion for foreign language and strong oral communication, written communication, and critical thinking skills to research, translate, transcribe, report, and analyze foreign intelligence. Your foreign language and English skills will provide key decision makers with a complete and accurate picture of the context within which the decision is being made (i.e. provide an understanding of the nuance, context, cultural overtones, and dialect in which the communication occurred). Another way to use your foreign language skills at NSA is to work as a scientific linguist. Scientific linguists support the mission by designing, developing, evaluating, and/or integrating products to enhance the understanding of mission critical foreign languages or materials by applying linguistic knowledge (e.g. syntax, morphology, phonetics, semantics) to address operational problems.QualificationsSalary Range: $48,583 - $74,759 (Entry/Developmental)\n*The qualifications listed are the minimum acceptable to be considered for the position.
