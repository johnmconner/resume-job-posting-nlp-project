Peritus significantly enhances operational efficiencies of existing support services, and enables managed service providers & system vendors to offer new business continuity entitlements. Peritus assists & automates a wide spectrum of decisions in system support including incident classification, routing, contract coverage, incident resolution recipes and orchestration of incident management between subject matter experts (SMEs).Peritus’ unique vectorization of system log data drives predictive modeling with highly granular feature extraction for early detection of system events. The platform’s advanced natural language processing (NLP) capabilities drive Peritus’ incident modeling and predictive capabilities. The core service fulfillment engine uses a combination of supervised and unsupervised methods to predict incident features from system log data. Peritus delivers automated orchestration of incident resolution through its close integration with existing incident management platforms.We are building a product that helps customers fulfill service requests as well as troubleshoot and diagnose infrastructure issues that cut across domains. The product needs to interface with configuration management systems/databases to glean insights into how systems are interconnected. Some of the key outcomes relate to the evolution of the interconnected systems over time through timestamped versioning of configuration trees, detection of anomalies via comparative analysis of the system with that of recommended best practices/solutions, and identification of interoperability issues by correlating configuration data across the infrastructure stack.We are looking to hire an engineering technical leader with deep systems knowledge. The role entails a deeper understanding of how data center systems interoperate, requiring familiarity with computing, storage, networking and virtualization products within a rack and across racks.

NESAP postdocs collaborate with scientific teams to enable the solution of deep, meaningful problems across all program areas funded by the Department of Energy Office of Science.NERSC provides world-class supercomputing, high performance, scalable data systems and services to 7000 users across more than 600 projects running 800 different codes. NERSC’s science impact is acknowledged by over 2000 publications per year.The Challenge: Enabling advanced data-intensive science at scale on energy-efficient supercomputers. In 2020, NERSC will begin deploying its first production heterogeneous CPU/GPU-based Cray supercomputer, “Perlmutter.” Perlmutter, a system optimized for science, includes future-generation AMD CPUs, next-generation NVIDIA GPUs, a high-speed interconnect, and an all-flash file system. Many codes running at NERSC must be adapted or optimized to run efficiently on GPUs, and solutions that put GPU performance in the hands of users must be portable ones. NESAP is about employing cutting-edge computational science techniques and advanced performance analysis tools to develop highly scalable, distributed parallel algorithms to meet this challenge.NESAP for Data (N4D): This posting is focused on the data-intensive science workload on Perlmutter. To answer today’s most complex experimental challenges, scientists are collecting exponentially more data and analyzing it with new computationally intensive algorithms. N4D addresses data-intensive science pipelines that process massive datasets from experimental and observational science (EOS) facilities like synchrotron light sources, telescopes, microscopes, particle accelerators, or genome sequencers. The goal is seamless integration and data flow between EOS facilities and supercomputing resources to enable scalable real-time data analytics: A “Superfacility.”As a N4D Fellow, you will be a part of a multidisciplinary team composed of computational and domain scientists working together to transition and optimize codes to the Perlmutter system and produce mission-relevant science that pushes the limits of HPC. You will carry out code transition efforts in collaboration with a project PI and team members with the support of NERSC and vendor staff. Successful candidates are expected to collaborate with each other across NESAP program areas (simulation and learning).Specific Responsibilities:Successful candidates will have one or more of the following responsibilities:All postdocs will have the responsibility to:Required Qualifications:Additional Desired Qualifications:GeneralThe posting shall remain open until the positions are filled.To be considered applications must include:Notes:NESAP has established a track record of enabling its postdocs to pursue careers in data science, HPC, and scientific computing both in industry and at national labs.

Yearning for a startup culture within a profitable nationwide company? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.It’s no secret the housing market has peaked. Lenders, banks and realtors are dying to know how to ride the down market and boost their margins. They are switching their customers to States Title because our data science algorithms, streamlined deal closing technologies, and overall product experience is leaps and bounds above what they’re used to in terms of speed and value.Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs our product: title and escrow. Title insurance protects banks and homeowners against financially irresponsible actors or legal issues that cloud their rights; escrow makes sure the right people get paid at the end of the day.Our streamlined, efficient algorithms have revolutionized the title and escrow process and allowed us to scale rapidly: we closed our acquisition of North American Title Company on January 7th. With a broader nationwide footprint, we are poised to transform this industry, repurposing the billions wasted in rote, manual tasks to make homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at PayPal, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way.

Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.Our Company & CultureWe are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win.
